# mutual.ie
A social network where the only way to connect is to be introduced.

## About
A lot of the best people I've ever met were introduced to me by somebody I already liked. Your mutual friend acts as a filter between the two of your. If we both like our mutual friend, there is a better chance than average we'll get along.

The only way for two people to talk to each other on __mutual.ie__ is if a mutual friend starts the conversation for them. 

If you want to talk to people you already know, go somewhere else: we only talk to people we don't know around here.

## Current Status
mutual.ie is currently a proof of tech: user authentication, instant messaging, message history and a usable frontend. It's basically a group chat that's open to anyone.

## Feature Roadmap
### In roughly decreasing order of priority
1. Prompt to generate a username on first log in: important to preserve privacy.
2. Allow for searching of and adding other users (the friends you already know)
3. Allow for a user to start a private conversation between two friends of theirs
